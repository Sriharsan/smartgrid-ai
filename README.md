# âš¡ SmartGrid-AI

**SmartGrid-AI** is an end-to-end AI system for **smart grid operations** that integrates:

- **Load Forecasting** â†’ Predict short-term electricity demand (LSTM, ARIMA).
- **Stability Classification** â†’ Detect grid stability using ML (XGBoost + SMOTE).
- **Economic Dispatch** â†’ Optimize renewable vs thermal generation using metaheuristics.
- **RL-like Control** â†’ Reinforcement-inspired policy for dispatch under uncertainty.
- **Interactive Dashboard** â†’ Streamlit app for real-time exploration and visualization.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- **Forecasting** â†’ LSTM-based demand forecasting with metrics (MAPE, RMSE).
- **Stability** â†’ Robust classification with >98% accuracy (XGBoost).
- **Optimization** â†’ Economic dispatch balancing renewables, thermal, and load shedding.
- **Control** â†’ RL-inspired controller with reward-based evaluation.
- **Dashboard** â†’ Mobile-friendly Streamlit interface with tabs:
  - Overview
  - Forecast
  - Dispatch
  - Stability
  - Controller
